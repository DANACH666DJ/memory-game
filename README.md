## Instructions

The game is divided mainly into 3 app.js files where we will give interactivity to our game. App.css where we will give styles to our game and index.html where we structure all the elements that we want our game to show.

To start the game you must press on any card and when searching for the first match of both cards, the game time will begin.
Once you find all the available pairs, the user will be informed of the time it has taken to finish the game and if he wants to play again.

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.
